# BANK_LOAN_DEFAULTS_PREDICTION

Bank loan default prediction refers to the use of data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. By analyzing historical data and relevant features such as credit score, income, loan amount, and employment status, predictive models can estimate the risk of loan default. This helps banks and financial institutions make informed lending decisions, reduce potential losses, and ensure responsible lending practices. Accurate default prediction enhances loan approval processes, safeguards the financial industry, and improves overall risk management, contributing to a stable and sustainable lending ecosystem.
